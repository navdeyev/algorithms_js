**Stack**

A stack is a last-in-first-out (LIFO) data structure: 
Elements are always removed in the reverse order in which they were added, 
much in the same way that you add or remove a dish from a stack of dishes.

The add element and remove element operations are conventionally called push and pop, respectively.
The peek operation returns the value of the top element in the stack without removing it from the stack.


**Max stack**

Enrich the standard api of a stack with a getMax() method, that will return the max element in the stack.
