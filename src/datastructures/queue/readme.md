**Queue**

A queue is a first-in-first-out (FIFO) data structure: 
Elements are always removed in the same order in which they were added,

The add element and remove element operations are conventionally called enqueue and dequeue, respectively.
The peek operation returns the value of the front element in the queue without dequeuing it.
