**Promises**

The Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation, and its resulting value.

**Async - Await**

Inside the function marked as *async*, you are allowed to put the *await* keyword in front of an
expression that returns a promise. When you do, the execution of the *async* function is paused
until the promise is resolved.

Async - await syntax allows us to write async code as if it was sync code. It uses promises under the hood.
