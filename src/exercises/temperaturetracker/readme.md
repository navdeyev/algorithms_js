**Temperature tracker**

Create a temperature tracker that will receive a new reading with insert() method and track four parameters:
- min: the min reading,
- max: the max reading,
- mean: the average value,
- mode: the most often-appearing reading

Optimize for space and time. Favor speeding up the getter functions 
getMax(), getMin(), getMean() and getMode() over speeding up the insert() function.
