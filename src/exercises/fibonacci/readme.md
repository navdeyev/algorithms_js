**Fibonacci numbers**
Calculate the n-th Fibonacci number.

Definition from Wikipedia:

In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers are the numbers in the following integer sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, and characterized by the fact that every number after the first two is the sum of the two preceding ones.

Simplest formula:

F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)

Fibonacci sequence example: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144...

Fibonacci numbers is probably the most popular task for explaining the concept of memoization - an optimization technique that is used if we know, that the algorithm will call the same function with the same parameters multiple times.
