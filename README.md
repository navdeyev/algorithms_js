# algorithms_js

This repo is my practice in standard algorithms and common algorithmic exercises available on various internet resources.

The repo is divided to directories that have some common theme, like, for example, search algorithms.
Each directory will contain
- short readme.md with the description of the problem;
- *.js file with at least one solution. Some might contain multiple solutions due to use of different approaches;
- *.test.js file with a set of tests to verify the correctness of the solution(s).

The repo uses a very minimalistic approach to configuration, basically providing access to the only necessary thing - Jest framework.

**Disclaimer**<br>
The algorithms and the solutions might not be optimal.
Please remember, that this is just my practice repo.
